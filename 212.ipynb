The difference is that an integration test may simply verify that you can query the database while a functional test would expect to get a specific value from the database as defined by the product requirements. Usually functional and integration tests merge into one. You might see integration tests handled as functional and functional as integration ones."

End-to-end tests are very useful, but they're expensive to perform and can be hard to maintain when they're automated. It is recommended to have a few key end-to-end tests and rely more on lower-level types of testing (unit and integration tests) to be able to quickly identify breaking changes. These tests can also be made by QA. They are really liked by mobile or web developers where user input and interactions with UI is commonly used."

This is another pro of writing tests - you need to write less comments. However, sometimes you can not avoid writing comments so you need to know why and how to do it. Writing comments and documentation is a really opinionated topic so take provided information with a grain of salt."

Docstrings are accessible from the doc attribute `(__doc__)` for any of the Python objects and also with the built-in `help()` function.* You should not use docstrings as the main source of documentation but it can really help to explain difficult functions in a huge library.\n",

[Here](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/docstrings) is a page that has a really in-depth explanation of the differences between comments and docstrings. The reach of docstrings is usually made by the mentioned functions above or by using `Pydoc`. Pydoc is a tool that lets developers to easily access and create code documentation.

Sometimes it is required that your project contains a license (creating Python package) but it is always a good practice to have one. The one thing that you must do is not to breach provided licenses. You can get into serious legal trouble by avoiding provided usage terms of software or code.
